# DevOps Bootcamp Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on DevOps journey through the TWN DevOps Bootcamp.
It contains real-world projects covering cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, containers,
Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, automation, and monitoring.

Each folder represents a module and contains production-style implementations rather than theoretical examples.
